  Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I store and showcase the various projects I've worked on during my online courses and internships.
  
  As these projects are mainly for personal learning and coursework, contributions are generaly not expected. However, if you have suggestions or improvements, 
feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

  This repository and its projects are open-sources under the applied Licenses.

  HAPPY CODING!
